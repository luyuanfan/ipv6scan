> Probe data in hard drive are mounted on `/mnt/usb`. So far, we have three files with data: `combined-48s-r1-s56.csv.bz2`, `combined-48s-r2-s60.csv.bz2`, `combined-48s-r3-s64.csv.bz2`.

Decompress:
```bash
nohup ./helper/decompress.sh &
```

Split files into smaller chunks for later processing:
```bash
nohup ./helper/split.sh & 
```

Load data into database:
```bash
python3 load.py --full
```

- Here we use `routeviews-rv6-20250730-0600.pfx2as`
```bash
./helper/pfx2as.sh
```

Import CAIDA's as2org dataset:
