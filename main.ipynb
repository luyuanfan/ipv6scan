    "In a dataset of IPv6 scan results we collected, we noticed that many network devices share identical lower 64 bits in their IPv6 addresses. Considering the most widely used IPv6 assignment mechanisms, such address collisions should be significantly less frequent than what we have observed. We want to find out the reason behind this.\n",

    "IPv6 address space is astronomically large. (It will take about a 100 million years to scan through all of them if we do 100 million scans every second!) The difficulty is tremendous compared to trying to scan the IPv4 addresses space, which we can do in 5 minutes with tools like [ZMap](https://zmap.io/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important characteristic of IPv6 address space is that it's extremely sparsely occupied -- only a tiny fraction of addresses have active devices behind them and the vast majority remain unused. Notably, the addresses that are assigned follow non-random patterns. Therefore, while brute-forcing through the entire IPv6 address space is impractical, it is fortunately unnecessary. Instead, we can focus on narrowing down the search space to target those likely occupied regions.\n",

The first six hexademical digits identifies the manufacturer of the NIC; and the last six should be unique numbers assigned by the manufacturer. \n",

    "network time servers. when a router is first configured, it requests from a network time server for the current time. (todo: do they have a list of time server addresses that are configured into this server? it seems unlikely that the router updates this list (if it exists!) on its own? where can the router obtain a list of time servers? is it allowed to be online if its time is really off?) the hypothesis is that these routers access (also wanna check how dns process work again) none of the time servers configured on this router's list is active anymore, so the router might be defaulting to the start of the unix epoch time (new year midnight 1970 UTC) which it in turns use as a seed to configure the lower 64 bits of the address. (todo: can't remember why we need to seed anything exactly. figure that out.) but again how are these routers even allowed online if the time is so off? but i guess maybe that's only a hard requirement for the endhost? find out about this."
