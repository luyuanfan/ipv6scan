    "ipv6 address space is huge and will take forever to do a full scan. (unlike ipv4 where using zmap you can scan the entire address space within a few hours) this address is also extremely sparsely occupied (most ipv6 address does not have an endpoint living there). therefore we want to cleverly select portions of the address space to scan. (why we want to do a scan? not sure yet.)\n",

    "iot device address configuration: pad mac address (which is 48 bits and conviniently already globally unique) with [SLAAC](https://www.networkacademy.io/ccna/ipv6/stateless-address-autoconfiguration-slaac). for this reason the lower 64 bits should be unique and never seen twice in the network. however, many identical lower 64 bits are seen repeatedly in the network. \n",

    "network time servers. when a router is first configured, it requests from a network time server for the current time. (todo: do they have a list of time server addresses that are configured into this server? it seems unlikely that the router updates this list (if it exists!) on its own? where can the router obtain a list of time servers? is it allowed to be online if its time is really off?) the hypothesis is that these routers access (also wanna check how dns process work again) none of the time servers configured on this router's list is active anymore, so the router might be defaulting to the start of the unix epoch time (new year midnight 1970 UTC) which it in turns use as a seed to configure the lower 64 bits of the address. (todo: can't remember why we need to seed anything exactly. figure that out.) but again how are these routers even allowed online if the time is so off? but i guess maybe that's only a hard requirement for the endhost? find out about this.
